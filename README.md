# Parkinson's Disease Predictor
This project involves developing machine learning models to predict Parkinson's Disease using various clinical data. The trained model has been saved as "PD_predictor.pkl". Detailed instructions on constructing the models and evaluating their performance are provided in the notebook "Parkinson's Disease Predictor.ipynb". For guidance on loading and using the model to make predictions, please refer to the tutorial in "PD_predictor.ipynb".
